### What
Welcome to my test github repository for Sir Primm lol

* This is a bullet point
* This is another bullet point
* wow this is a bullet pointing

### How
I created files using
* touch

I used GitBash installed and used
* git add .
* git commit -m "Added test files"
* git push

Then I used my Github username and the password is a token from https://github.com/settings/tokens

Then I was bored so I added more files and added some content.

Then repeat the proccess of adding, committing and pushing.
